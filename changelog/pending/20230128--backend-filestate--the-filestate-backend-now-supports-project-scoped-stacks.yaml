  scope: backend/filestate
  description: |
    The filestate backend now supports project scoped stacks.
    Newly initialized storage will automatically use this mode.
    You can migrate your old state store to enable project support by running `pulumi state upgrade`.
    Note that this will make the state incompatible with old CLI versions.
    Old CLI versions will not understand new stacks, but may write stack files to the old locations;
    new CLIs will warn if they see those files and suggest running `pulumi state migrate` again.
