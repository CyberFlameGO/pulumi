# This script is designed to run against a merge commit, either produced during PR checks or a
# `bors` octopus merge commit. A non-zero exit status is returned if either of the following is true
# of the COMMITISH (see below)
# * If COMMITISH is not a merge commit (i.e.: has 0 or 1 parents.)
# * If COMMITISH is a merge commit and any of the parents have a non-linear history with the common ancestor
#   of the target commit (first parent).

# usage: ./scripts/git-linear-history-check.sh [COMMITISH]
#
#   COMMITISH: a commit to use, if not provided, HEAD is used.
#

# ## Non-linear merge example
#
# Merge commit hash: fc7c341c38c006f96ac288ebfcf5ce18b8e31a48
#
# PR commits: https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/pull/11095/commits
#
# This commit is a single merge commit produced by `bors`. The 2nd parent of the commit is the PR
# commit HEAD and the commit history shows a merge commit. This script should log errors and exit
# with a 1 on this commit.

# ## Linear merge example

# Merge commit hash: 2a98a6e4dc36524fde5d33f2b5bdca0521441c72
#
# PR commits: https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/pull/11261/commits
#
# This is a regular PR merge, containing a single commit. This script should not log any errors on
# this commit.


# ## Non-linear octopus merge example

# 2. https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/pull/10729/commits
# 3. https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/pull/10740/commits
#
# This octopus merge has 3 PRs as parents. The first of which (#10687) has non-linear commit
# history. This script should log two errors and exit with a 1.
